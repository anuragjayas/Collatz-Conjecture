This program is used to create a collatz conjecture.

To copy a file follow the instructions:
1. "gcc collatz.c"
2. "./a.out"
3. Follow the onscreen prompts

The algorithm of the code can be shown as:
1. Acquire the intial number to create collatz conjecture
2. Creating a child process
3. Check the condition for the child process
4. Create a collatz conjecture if a child process is created
5. Check whether the child process has ended or nit
6. If child process is completed than parent process would run and end
7. Termination
